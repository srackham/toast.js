= toast.js browser notifier library

== toast.js
Toast.js is a flexible minimalist JavaScript popup notifications
library written in TypeScript.

- http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html[Bootstrap] friendly
  but does not depend on Bootstrap (notification types and colors
  match Bootstrap alerts).

- Inspired by https://github.com/Srirangan/notifer.js[notifier.js]
  and https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr[toastr].

http://www.methods.co.nz/misc/toast/toast-examples.html[Live demo].

=== Usage
Include `toast.js` and `toast.css` (along with JQuery) then call the
Toast popup functions from your code e.g.

  Toast.info('Hello World!');

The nice thing about popups for transient message reporting is their
ease of use -- just a single statement per message (no HTML markup or
DOM manipulation required).

Toast.js uses jQuery so you'll also need to include it.  See
the `toast-examples.html` examples.

Toast has been also been published as a Meteorite
https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/toastjs[smart package] for
use with the http://meteor.com/[Meteor] Web framework.

=== API
Popup functions:

  Toast.info    (message [,title [, options]])
  Toast.warning (message [,title [, options]])
  Toast.error   (message [,title [, options]])
  Toast.success (message [,title [, options]])

Function parameters:

  message: String
  title:   String
  options: Object with properties to override Toast.defaults

The read-write `Toast.defaults` object contains the following
configuration properties:

  width:            CSS length, overrides CSS file.
  append:           Boolean, whether to append new Toasts (defaults to prepend)
  center:           Boolean, whether to center Toast (defaults to left align)
  displayDuration:  In milliseconds, set to 0 to make sticky.
  fadeOutDuration:  In milliseconds.

Behavior:

- Toast popups are inserted into the top of the toast container
  (existing messages are pushed down).
- The toast container is a 'div' element with ID 'toast-container', if
  it doesn't already exist Toast.js creates and inserts it into the
  DOM 'body' element.
- The popups are removed from the toast container when they timeout or
  are clicked by the user.

Examples:

----
Toast.info('Simple message');
Toast.success('Message with title', 'Title');
Toast.error('Sticky message', '', {displayDuration: 0});
Toast.defaults.displayDuration = 1000;
Toast.defaults.fadeOutDuration = 800;
Toast.defaults.width = '800px';
----

=== Building
To generate `toast.js` JavaScript from the `toast.ts` source file copy
the `jquery.d.ts` type declaration file from the TypeScript
distribution to the build directory then run the Typescript compiler:

  tsc toast.ts

If you have https://github.com/mde/jake[jake] installed you can run:

  jake build
